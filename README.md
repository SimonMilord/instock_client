# InStock Inventory management web application

InStock is a responsive inventory management application that allows users to keep track of inventories spread across multiple warehouses. Users can add, edit, delete both warehouses and inventory items. The app itself was built with React and SASS on the frontend and Node and Express on the backend.

## The Context

InStock was built as a week-long team project for the Brainstation program where we got to collaborate in an agile development environment using Jira Software. We got to work with both frontend and backend technologies as well as exposure working with Figma wireframes.
My contributions range from backend routing, to React logic, to building some React components for the frontend including styling with SASS. I was also acting project manager, responsible for deadlines and tasks attribution on Jira.
